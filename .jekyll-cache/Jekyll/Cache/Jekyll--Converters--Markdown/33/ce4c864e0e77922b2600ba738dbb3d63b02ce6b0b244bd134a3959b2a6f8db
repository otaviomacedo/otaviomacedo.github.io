<p>Structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduction etc</li>
  <li>Brief explanation of the programâ€™s design</li>
  <li>Mention the need to compute the winner</li>
  <li>Describe how this should be done using a diagram</li>
  <li>Show the outcome method and how it relates to the diagram</li>
  <li>This is fine, but the deeper algebraic connection is lost</li>
  <li>Discuss:
    <ul>
      <li>First of all, both are reduce</li>
      <li>How product is associative, commutative and idempotent -&gt; semilattice</li>
      <li>This induces an ordering</li>
      <li>Every subset has a maximal</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Refactor with the maximal</li>
  <li>Conclusion: not too big of a deal, but it shows how algebraic structures appear everywhere</li>
</ul>

<p>The game is structured into three main abstractions: the Board, the Game and the Player, of which we have two implementations: the Computer and the User. Fooooooo</p>
