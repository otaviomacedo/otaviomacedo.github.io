I"O<p>Regular expressions are one of those things that bring joy and frustration at the same time to most software developers. At one point or another, weâ€™ve all written functions to match strings against some regular expression, as part of a bigger function, class, component etc. In this post, I want to show you one of the counterintuitive results from Computability Theory, that involves regular expressions. The code samples are all in Scala, mainly because, in my opinion, it is concise in many respects, but, at the same time, reasonably familiar to a wide audience of developers.</p>
